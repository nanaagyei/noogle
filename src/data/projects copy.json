    "searchDescription": "A research project that explores a comparative analysis of preprocessing techniques used for facial recognition from a dataset of 1000 images",
    "longDescription": "Using Python, I explored three popular methods used in facial recognition: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Karhunen-Loeve Expansions (KL-Expansions), which is fundamentally a continuous form of PCA but with stochastic random processes. I implemented Python scripts from scratch to explore the use of interpolation and resampling techniques on facial recognition accuracy using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Images were preprocessed by mean subtraction, followed by linear interpolation, cubic spline interpolation, and resampling to standardize their dimensions. The processed images were then subjected to SVD to extract eigenfaces. The analysis revealed that cubic spline interpolation better preserves facial details critical for recognition compared to resampling. This finding underscores the importance of choosing suitable preprocessing methods in facial recognition systems, with implications for enhancing their accuracy and applicability in various domains.",
